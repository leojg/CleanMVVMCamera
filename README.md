# CleanMVVMCamera

This is a demo project to present an implementation of android cameraX using MVVM+Clean Architecture

The reason for this is because there are several examples of how to implement Clean Architecture on more common use cases, such as making a server request, 
but there are far less that show how to do it when interacting with device sensors, the camera in this case.
